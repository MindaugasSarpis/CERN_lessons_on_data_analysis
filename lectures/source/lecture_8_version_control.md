# The Importance of Version Control

- ### Even if working alone, many different version of the same file will exist. 
- ### Some overwritten changes might be needed later.
- ### A "versioned" file might be needed when implementing comments from supervisor / reviewers. 
- ### This hold true for written work, code and other files.

# Tracking Changes (differences)  

- ## Rather than saving multiple copies of the same file, we can track changes.
- ## `git` is an open-source version control system that is used to track changes in files.
