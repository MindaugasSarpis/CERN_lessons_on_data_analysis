# The Importance of Version Control

- ### Even if working alone, many different version of the same file will exist. 
- ### Some overwritten changes might be needed later.
- ### A "versioned" file might be needed when implementing comments from supervisor / reviewers. 
- ### This hold true for written work, code and other files. 
  
---

# Tracking Changes (differences)  

- ### Rather than saving multiple copies of the same file, we can track changes.
- ###  Word processors and other software have some changes-tracking functionality but it is limited (no synchronous editing, no change history, etc.).
- ### `git` is an open-source version control system that is used to track changes in files.

# Different Versions 

- ### An eddit to a file might overwrite some of the content in the previous version.
- ### This *divergences* may arrise while working alone, but they are really common when multiple people are working on the same file.

# Merging 

- ### `git` has great functionality for merging different versions of the same file.
- ### If the previous content is not overwritten, or deleted, merge just combines the changes into one file.
- ### If changes over-write each other a so-called **merge conflict** arises.

# Using `git` for the first time 

- ### The user name and email address need to configured.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Mindaugas Sarpis"
git config --global user.email "mindaugas.sarpis@cern.ch"
```

- ### Check the configuration with:

```bash
git config --list
```

- ### Edit the configuration with:
  
```bash
git config --global --edit
```

- ### Open configuration help:
   
```bash
git config --h
git config --help
```

# Creating a new repository

- ### A repository is initialized with the following command:

```bash
git init
```

- ### This command creates a new repository in the current directory. 

- ### The repository is a hidden directory called `.git` that contains all the information changes tracked by `git`.

- ### You can check the status of the repository with:

```bash
git status
```

::right::

![](./resources/git/git-staging-area.svg)

- ### The repository is empty at this point and the output will be:
    
```bash
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

---
layout: two-cols

# Staging Area

- ### `git` has a staging area where files are placed to track the changes made to them.  

- ###  To move a file to the staging area use: 
  
  ```bash
  git add <file>
  ```

- ### To move all files to the staging area use: 
  
  ```bash
  git add --all
  ```

- ### To unstage a file use: 
    
    ```bash
    git restore --staged <file>
    ```
 
- ### Changes to files can be viewed with:
  ```bash
  git diff
  ```

::right::

![](./resources/git/git-staging-area.svg)

- ### When staged files are present, the output of `git status` will be:

```bash
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   <file>
```

---
layout: two-cols
---

# Committing Changes

- ### Files are committed to the repository from the staging area with:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "A message describing the changes"
  ```
- ### Commit is a snapshot of the repository at a given time.

- ### Only changes to files are tracked, not the directories themselves. 
- ### It's best to keep the commits small and focused on a single change.
- ### The commit message should be descriptive and concise.
- ### The commit message should be in the present tense.

# Restoring Changes

- ### Changes to files can be restored to the last commit with:

  ```bash
  git restore < file >
  ```

- ### Changes to files can be restored to the last commit and the staging area with:

  ```bash
  git restore --staged < file >
  ```

- ### Changes to files from previous commits can be restored using the *hash* of the commit:

  ```bash
  git restore --source=<hash> < file >
  ```
::right::

![](./resources/git/git-restore.svg)

- ### A new commit reverting the changes can be made with:
  ```bash
  git revert < hash >
  ```

- ### The entire repository can be restored to the last commit with deleting the changes:

  ```bash
  git reset --hard < hash >
  ```

# Ignoring Files and Directories 

- ### There might be files that you don't want to track with `git`.

  - #### Temporary files
  - #### Output files 
  - #### Files with sensitive information
  - #### Large files

- ### These files can be ignored by creating a `.gitignore` file in the repository.

# Git Remotes

- ### One of the most powerful features of `git` is the ability to work with remote repositories.
- ### Remote repositories are copies of the repository that are stored on a server.
- ### Using one of the remote providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.) you can store your repository in the cloud.
- ### This enables collaboration with other people and provides a backup of your work.
