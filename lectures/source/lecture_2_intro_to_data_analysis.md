# What is data analysis? 

---


# Data analysis is a process of **inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data** with the goal of **discovering useful information, informing conclusions,e and supporting decision-making**.

# Key Ideas 

- ## Any **experiment** (study or analysis) in any field of science **should have** a **data analysis** component
- ## This is stage of **interpretation of the results** of the experiment. 
- ## Normally, the **results of data analysis** appear in scientific publications.
