### Introduction to Data Analysis

---

# What is **data** analysis? 

---


# **Data analysis** is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of **discovering** useful **information**, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.

# Key Ideas 

- ## Any **experiment** (study or analysis) in any field of science **will have** a **data analysis** component
- ## This is the stage of **interpretation of the results** of the experiment. 
- ## Normally, the **results of data analysis** appear in scientific publications.
