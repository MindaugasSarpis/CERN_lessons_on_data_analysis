## **Data analysis** is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling **data** with the goal of discovering useful **information**, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making

# What is **Data Science**?

---

## **Data science** is an interdisciplinary academic field that uses statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processing, scientific visualization, algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate **knowledge and insights** from potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data

&nbsp;

# Wikipedia

# **Key** Ideas 

- ## Any experiment (study or analysis) in any field of science will have a data analysis component
  
- ## Normally, the **results of data analysis** appear in scientific **publications**
  
- ## In business data analysis is imperative for **decision making**

# Steps of **Data Analysis** 

---

 # 1. **Define** the Problem or Research Question 

- ## Formulation
  
  This might steer the choices in the following steps

- ## Experimental Design

###### Interactive exercise

# 2. **Collect** Data 

- ## How much data do you need?

- ## What sort of data do you need?

- ## What data formats should you chose?
  
- ## Can you trust the data?

- ## Can you collect the data?

---

# 3. **Clean** Data 

- ## Data Selection

- ## Data Stripping

- ## Data Skimming

- ## Data Wrangling

- ## ...

# 4. **Analyze** Data

- ## Data Exploration

- ## Statistical Analysis

- ## Model Building

- ## Machine Learning

- ## Classification (...**AI**...)

---

# 5. **Visualize** the data

- ## What's your target audience?
  
- ## What is the message you want to convey?

---

# 6. **Interpret** and **report** the results

- ## Draw Conclusions from Data
  
- ## Report Findings

## The first step in **(re)using data** is to find them. **Metadata** and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.

---

# **Findable** data

- ## **F1.** (Meta)data are assigned a globally **unique** and persistent **identifier**

- ## **F2.** Data are described with **rich metadata**

- ## **F3.** **Metadata** clearly and explicitly **include the identifier** of the data they describe

- ## **F4.** (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a **searchable resource**

###### What's metadata?

---

# **Accessible** data

- ## **A1.** **(Meta)data** are retrievable by their **identifier** using a standardised communications protocol

  - ## **A1.1** The protocol is **open**, free, and universally implementable

  - ## **A1.2** The protocol allows for an **authentication** and **authorisation** procedure, where necessary

- ## **A2.** Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

---

# **Interoperable** data

- ## **I1.** (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable **language for knowledge representation**

- ## **I2.** (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow **FAIR principles**

- ## **I3.** (Meta)data include **qualified references** to other (meta)data

---

# **Reusable** data

- ## **R1.** (Meta)data are **richly described** with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

  - ## **R1.1.** (Meta)data are released with a clear and **accessible** data usage **license**

  - ## **R1.2.** (Meta)data are associated with detailed **provenance**

  - ## **R1.3.** (Meta)data meet **domain-relevant community standards**

- ## Easy to learn / use (GUI)

---

# **Programming** Languages 

- ## Open Source
- ## Free
- ## Powerful 
- ## Steep learning curve (CLI)

---

# **Discussion**  

- ## When to use proprietary tools?
- ## What should you be using?  
- ## Saturation of achieved proficiency
