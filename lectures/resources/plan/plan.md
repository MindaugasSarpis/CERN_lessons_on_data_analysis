Below is a possible outline of how to structure your course for STEM researchers who may not have extensive experience in data analysis, programming, or statistics. The overarching theme is to start with the fundamentals of computing (hardware, software, and basic principles) and build up toward the essential data hygiene practices and example workflows that will help them become more efficient and rigorous in their data work.

## 5. Data Collection, Cleaning & Preparation
1. **Data ingestion**  
   - Different file formats (CSV, JSON, parquet, netCDF, etc.) and how to load them in chosen languages/tools.  
   - Large datasets: chunk reading, streaming vs. batch processing.  
2. **Data cleaning**  
   - Common pitfalls (missing values, outliers, format inconsistencies).  
   - Tools/libraries (Pandas, data.table, etc.).  
   - String parsing, date/time manipulation, dealing with different encodings.  
3. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
   - Summaries (mean, median, standard deviation) and data distribution checks.  
   - Visual exploratory tools (histograms, scatter plots, box plots).  
4. **Data transformation & feature engineering (if relevant)**  
   - Data merging, pivoting, reshaping.  
   - Creating new features, filtering irrelevant data.

## 6. Statistics & Data Analysis Fundamentals
*(This can be kept at a conceptual level if participants are quite new.)*  
1. **Basic statistical concepts**  
   - Mean, variance, confidence intervals, p-values.  
   - Correlations vs. causation.  
2. **Common analysis patterns**  
   - Regression, classification, time series basics.  
   - Potential pitfalls (overfitting, underfitting).  
3. **Computational concerns**  
   - Efficient usage of CPU vs. GPU for large-scale computations.  
   - Memory constraints (when dealing with big data).  
   - Distributed computing (Spark, Dask, or HPC).

## 7. Data Visualization & Communication
1. **Principles of effective data visualization**  
   - Choosing the right chart type, color scales, labeling.

### Teaching Format Suggestions
- **Lectures + live demos**: Demonstrate each topic step-by-step with practical examples (e.g., reading a CSV, cleaning data, using Git).
- **Hands-on labs/workshops**: Small exercises where learners actually implement what they’ve learned (e.g., set up version control, write a basic data-cleaning script).
- **Short quizzes**: Reinforce key points (e.g., naming conventions, version control commands).
- **Project-based learning**: Encourage a final mini-project that encompasses setting up a repository, organizing data, writing scripts/notebooks, and producing a reproducible report.

### Key Points to Emphasize
1. **Reproducibility**: It’s not just about getting results; it’s about making it easy to track how you got them.  
2. **Data organization & hygiene**: Good file structures, naming, and documentation make future analyses and collaborations smoother.  
3. **Resource awareness**: Understanding when and how to use CPU vs. GPU, local vs. cloud, is valuable for efficient and scalable data work.  
4. **Incremental learning**: Emphasize that mastery of these topics comes from repeated application in real projects, not just theory.

By starting with fundamental computer science concepts (hardware, software, basic architecture), you ensure everyone has the same baseline. Then gradually move into data handling best practices, programming essentials, and finally data analysis and reproducibility strategies. This progression helps researchers build a holistic mindset around how computing resources and good data practices intersect—leading them to more robust, efficient, and credible research outcomes.
